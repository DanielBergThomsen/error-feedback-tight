# Tight analyses of first-order methods with error feedback
This is the official repo for the paper available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05271).
We make the following contributions in the paper:
- tight analyses of **EF and EF21** with contractive compression operators,
on smooth strongly convex functions in the **single-worker case** ($n=1$) üìà
- lower bounds matching the upper bounds proven above ‚öñÔ∏è
- **optimal** step size settings for EF and EF21 ‚ö°
- show that EF and EF21 have the exact same convergence rate within the space of allowable Lyapunov functions üîÑ
- introduce a methodology for finding *simple*, yet *optimal*, Lyapunov functions to analyze üî¨


This repository contains the code to reproduce all figures and tables from our paper. To facilitate reproducibility, we have implemented:

- A command-line interface for generating individual figures/tables or all results at once
- Automatic data caching to avoid recomputing results unnecessarily

The repository additionally allows you to verify some of the proofs written in the paper by running a script written in Wolfram Language.

## Setup

To get started, we recommend creating a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments

The experiments can be run in two ways:

1. Generate all figures and tables at once:
```bash
python experiments.py all
```

2. Generate individual figures or tables:
```bash
# Generate Figure 1 (performance comparison)
python experiments.py "Figure 1"

# Generate Table 1 (EF vs EF21 comparison)
python experiments.py "Table 1"
```

Note: 
- Running all experiments from scratch with `grid_resolution = 200` takes quite a while. You can set it to e.g. 50 and still get decent looking plots. Subsequent runs are pretty much immediate because of the saved data.
- You should delete the data folder if you make any changes to the code.

## Verifying proofs
In order to verify the proofs, you should install the Wolfram Engine, which is available for free at https://www.wolfram.com/engine/.

After following the install instructions for your platform, you can verify the rates we show by simply running
```bash
wolframscript -script verify_proofs.wls
```
in the root of the project directory.
